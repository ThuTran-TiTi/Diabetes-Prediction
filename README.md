# Nonparametric Statistical Analysis for Diabetes Prediction

## Overview

This project utilizes nonparametric statistics and R programming to predict whether patients have diabetes or not. The analysis is based on relevant medical data, and the nonparametric statistical methods employed offer robust predictions without assuming specific distributions in the underlying data.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a reliable predictive model for identifying patients at risk of diabetes using nonparametric statistical techniques.

## Methods Used

- Nonparametric statistical analysis
- R programming language

## Dataset

The analysis is conducted on a dataset containing relevant medical features and labeled outcomes regarding the presence or absence of diabetes.
